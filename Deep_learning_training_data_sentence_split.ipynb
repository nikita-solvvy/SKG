       " '&quot; Iqra , Support.Your profile has been switched back to “ public ” and clients will be able to see you in search results again.Just a reminder , if 30 days pass and you have no earnings we will set your profile back to “ private , ” meaning it will not appear in search results . To avoid this , you have two options : .Start earning again on Upwork.Sign up for a Freelancer Plus membership to keep your profile public when you aren ’ t regularly earning . It ’ s $ 10 a month and includes other perks , such as extra Connects and the ability to see what other freelancers are bidding on jobs ... If your profile is set to private again ( we ’ ll notify you if it is ) , you also can contact us again to make it public . Should you have any questions or need further assistance , please dont hesitate to get in touch . Thanks for using Upwork ! Regards , MariaUpwork Support . &quot;',\n",

       " '&quot; Hi Cody , Customer Support.We suspended your Upwork contract because your clients account was suspended . There are many possible reasons for your client ’ s suspension , although we won ’ t discuss specifics due to privacy concerns.Here ’ s what to do if your contract is suspended : Stop working on the contract immediately – Do not resume work until you receive a notification from Upwork that the contract is reactivated . For hourly contracts , you ’ ll receive payment for any hours logged prior to the account suspension.Please ask your client to contact Customer Support directly so that he will be assisted accordingly.Please let me know if there is anything else you need assistance with for the meantime.Regards , .Amber.Upwork Customer Support &#124; .
