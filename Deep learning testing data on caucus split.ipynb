I entered into similar arrangement with several other freelancers . On the basis of the number of records that we expected and frelancers hourly rate i provided a budgeted number of hours suffcient for the freelancer to complete the job ... in one particular case the freelancer has been quite unproductive ( this was a consequence of the work process the freelancer adopted ) and consumed the entire budget while only completing about 15 % of the work. the other freelancers have completed their work on budget ... on the basis of our initial $ per record agreement ( as seen in the message trail ) i should pay the freelancer for ~ 8 hours . In practice he has done 50 hours of work . I didnt want to take advantage of the guy so i told him that i would pay 20 hours. he says that because i set it up as an hourly job and provided for 50 hours ( my estimate of how long he should have taken to do 100 % of the work ) then he is entitled to claim 50 hours ... is there a right / wrong here ? ive been using upwork for a while but not that experienced. i dont know if he is right when he says that it is my problem for setting this up as an hourly job. this is my first dispute and i dont like it ! any advice as to how i can proceed ?',\n",

Hi , My paypal account associated with this Upwork account was disassociated few weeks back accidentally . Now today when I plan to re-associate the paypal account , your system is restricting that my Upwork email address and Paypal email address should match . My earlier associated paypal account was not of the same email address and now i cannot create a new Paypal account for Upwork , as it will start a new round of verification etc. etc. Neither i want to change my Upwork email address as this is actually my work email address ... Im stuck . Guide me please ... Regards . &quot;',\n",

Even at the start of the contract , upwork showed the clients payment method was unverified . This made me NOT work for the client ( even upwork suggested to stop working untill the issue is solved , which never happened ) . On this , client raised disputes - which I accepted and refunded every single penny back to the client ( which practically I never earned - as clients payments were failing ) . I sensed a fraud here , and to avoid being scammed , I didnt shared much files to the client . This led him to abuse and bullying a lot . I raised the support tickets for this too . However , I refunded the money and the contract is closed . .My question is why such contracts affect your JSS ? It wasnt my fault if the client was not paying for the hours worked .
